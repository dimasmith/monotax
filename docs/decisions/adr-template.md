## Context and Problem Statement

I need to keep track of decisions made during this project. I develop Monotax sporadically and may change my mind about things. Keeping context for major changes helps to maintain the project in the future.

## Decision

I will use the Architecture Decision Records (ADR) format to document decisions made during the development of Monotax.

## Alternatives

Enumerate alternative approaches. What other options were considered? What are the trade-offs of each?

### Use a wiki

I could use a wiki to document decisions. This would allow for more flexibility in formatting and linking between documents. However, a wiki would require more maintenance and would not be as easily versioned as text files.

### Use a blog

I could use a blog to document decisions. This would allow for more flexibility in formatting and linking between documents. However, a blog would require more maintenance and would not be as easily versioned as text files.

## Consequences

Describe the consequences of the decision. What are the trade-offs? What will be the impact on the project? What are the risks?
