# Record Architecture Decisions

Date: `2024-07-02`
Status: `Accepted`

## Context and Problem Statement

I need to keep track of decisions made during this project. I develop Monotax sporadically and may change my mind about things. Keeping context for major changes helps to maintain the project in the future.

## Decision

I will use the Architecture Decision Records (ADR) format to document decisions made during the development of Monotax.

The template for ADRs is available in [adr-template.md](adr-template.md).
